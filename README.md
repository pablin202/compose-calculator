# Jetpack Compose Calculator App

Simple Calculator App is an Android application developed in Kotlin that provides basic calculator functionality. The app is built using Jetpack Compose and follows the MVVM architecture pattern. It includes unit tests using JUnit, Mockito, and Hamcrest, as well as UI tests using the Compose testing library.

## Features

- **Jetpack Compose**: The app's user interface is developed using Jetpack Compose, a modern toolkit for building native UI in a declarative way.

- **MVVM Architecture**: The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern, which separates the presentation, business logic, and data layers.

- **Calculator Functionality**: The app allows users to perform basic mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests are implemented using JUnit, Mockito, and Hamcrest. These tests ensure the correctness of the app's business logic and data manipulation.

## UI Tests

UI tests are implemented using the Compose testing library. These tests verify that the user interface components and interactions behave as expected.
